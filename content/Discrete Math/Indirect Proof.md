## Abstract
---
- When [[Direct Proof]] is hard to derive, we can try indirect proof

### Disproof by Counterexample (反例法)
- An example that shows that a [[Mathematical Statement]] isn't always true 

>[!important]
> Useful for disproving [[Universal Statement]]

>[!example]
> - [[disproof_by_counter_example_1.png|Disproof the product of two irrational numbers is always irrational.]]

### Proof by Contradiction (矛盾证明法)
- An [[#Indirect Proof]], to prove a [[Mathematical Statement|mathematical statement]] is false, prove its negation is true, and vice versa. This is useful when [[Direct Proof|direct proof]] is difficult, and the negated statement has a form that is easier to prove.

>- [[Integer (整数)#Theorem 4.6.1|There isn't a greatest integer]]


### Proof by Contraposition (逆否命证明法)
- Use when the [[Conditional Statement#Contrapositive (逆否命题)]] is easier to proof
