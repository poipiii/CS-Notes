## Abstract
---
- Also known as **Propositional Functions** & **Open Sentences**
- Predicate is a function([[#Predicate Symbol]]) that accepts a valid input to its [[#Predicate Variable]] and return either **true** or **false**
- Example: let $P()$, the predicate symbol stands for `is a student at NUS` and $x$ be the predicate variable. Together, we get $P(x)$ which stands for $x$ `is a student at NUS`


>[!caution] Dynamic Truth Value
>Depends on the values we substituted to the Predicate Variable

>[!caution] Not a Mathematical Statement
>Only becomes a [[Mathematical Statement]] when specific values are substituted to the Predicate Variable, and we call it **Closed Predicate**. Otherwise **Open Predicate**

>[!caution] Predicate is not a Predicate Variable
> Can't be used as a Predicate Variable that is substituted into Predicate Symbol like $P()$. Because Predicate is meant to return either `true` or `false` with value substituted 

### Predicate Variable
- Holds value that determines if [[Predicate]] is **true** or **false**
>[!caution] Not a Mathematical Statement
>It doesn't hold the value of **true** or **false**! Only [[Mathematical Statement]] can be **true** or **false**
### Predicate Symbol
- Represents a property or [[Relation]]

### Domain of Predicate Variable
- The set of all values that may be substituted in place of the [[#Predicate Variable]]
- Also known as **Domain of Discourse**, **Universe of Discourse**, **Universal Set** & **Universe**
### Truth Set
- The set of values in [[#Domain of Predicate Variable]] substituted to [[#Predicate Variable]] that makes the [[Predicate]] return true
- Detonated by ${x \in D \mid P(x)}$, meaning a particular value $x$ is an element of the Domain of Predicate Variable, such that the **Closed Predicate** is `true`
