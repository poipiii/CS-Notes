## Abstract
---
$$
\forall, \exists
$$

- Instead of manually assigning a specific value to a [[Predicate#Predicate Variable|predicate variable]] to obtain a [[Mathematical Statement|mathematical statement]], quantifiers provide another way to specify **how many values of a particular type** can make the predicate a **closed predicate**


>[!info] Implicit quantification
> The Quantifiers are assumed without specified explicitly

## Statements with Multiple Quantifiers
---
- [[Predicate]] with more than one [[Quantifier]]

>[!important] Order of Quantifiers
>Unless the **Quantifiers** are of the **same type**. Otherwise, the meaning is different.

> Given $P(x,y)$ is **x loves y**
> 1. $\forall x \exists y, P(x,y)$  in english: For all people x, there is a person y such that x loves y.
> 2. $\exists y \forall x, P(x,y)$ in english: There is a person y such that all people x, x loves y.

> - The first one means for everyone (you, me, he), there is someone we love
> - The second one means there is someone who is loved by everyone (you, me, he)
