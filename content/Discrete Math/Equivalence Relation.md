## Abstract
---
- Let $A$ be a [[Set]] and $R$ be a [[Relation]] on $A$
- $R$ is equivalence relation iff $R$ is [[#Reflexive]], [[#Symmetric]] and [[#Transitive]]

### Equivalence Class
- Basically same as the **component** of a [[Set Partition]] or elements of [[#Equivalence Relation]]
- Can be represented with $[a]_{relation}$, it means the Equivalence Class contains element $a$
- $[a]_{relation}$ and $[b]_{relation}$ are the same iff $b$ is in the same equivalence class as $a$

### Lemma Rel.1
- [[Equivalence Relation]]
- Let `~` be an *[[#Equivalence Class]]* on [[Set]] $A$ and $x, y \in A$
	1. $x$ is equivalent related to $y$
	2. The equivalent class $x$ is in is same as the equivalent class $y$ is in
	3. $[x] \cap [y] \ne \emptyset$
