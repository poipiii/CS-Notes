## Abstract
---
- [[#Concise]], [[#Polished]] [[Mathematical Argument]] explaining the **validity** of [[Mathematical Statement]]
- There are 2 types of proofs - [[Direct Proof]] and [[#Indirect Proof (反证法)]]

>[!important]
> We can use [[Mathematical Statement#Theorem (定理)]] to supporting the proof. A proof can be traced back to to [[Mathematical Statement#Axioms (公理)]], along with accepted [[Rule of Inference (推理规则)]].

### Concise
- There is no irrelevant details
### Polished
- Should be the final drift
### Without Loss Of Generality (WLOG)
- Used before an assumption in a *proof* which narrows the *premise* to some special case
- And implies that proof for that case can be easily applied to all other cases
- To remove very similar proof, for example, `a` & `b` are two consecutive odd number. We need to proof the product of the 2 consecutive odd numbers is always odd
- we need to proof it correct for both `a<b` & `b<a` cases, we can remove proof for one of the cases using `WLOG`
