## Abstract
---
$$
\{9, 8, 7\} = \{7, 9, 8\} = \{7, 8, 7, 9, 9, 7, 7\}
$$
- A **unordered** collection of elements, so the **order** and **duplicates** don't matter

>[!info]- Set Elements
> - Example: `1`, `2`, `3` `{1}` are objects in the set of [[Integer (整数)]]
> - It can be either a **value** or a **set**



### Membership of a Set
$$
\in, \not\in
$$
$$
b \in {a, b, c}
$$

### Cardinality of a Set
$$
|\{a, b, c\}| = 3
$$
- The size of the [[Set|Set]]
