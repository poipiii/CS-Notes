## Abstract
---
- A [[Set|Set]] that contains $0$ element
- Represented with $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$
- $\emptyset \not\in \{\}$, but  $\emptyset \subseteq \{\}$ and $\emptyset \in \{\emptyset\}$, where $\{\emptyset\}$ contains 1 element

>[!caution] 
> Not a **Null Set**.

#### Theorem 6.2.4
- An [[Empty Set]] is a s [[Subset]] of every [[Set|Set]]
</br>

- Assume $A$ is all the possible sets, $\emptyset \subseteq A$
- Can be proved using [[Universal Statement#Vacuous Truth of Universal]] with the [[Subset|definition of subset]]

### Singleton
- A [[Set|set]] with exactly one element
