## Abstract
---
- Also known as **Pairwise Disjoint** or **Non-overlapping***
- Refer to [[#Partition]], the elements inside $\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\}$ partition are **Mutually Disjoin**
- $A$ is called **Union of Mutually Disjoint Subsets**
- The collection of sets $\{A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\}$ is said to be a partition of $A$ 

### Disjoin Set
$$
A \cap B = \emptyset
$$
- Given 2 [[Set|Set]], both don't have **any elements** in common
