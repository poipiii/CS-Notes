## Abstract
---
$$
A \times B = \{(a,b) : a\in A \land b\in B\}
$$
- Given [[Set|Set]] `A` and `B`, the Cartesian product is a set of [[Ordered Pair]]. Therefore $A \times B \neq B \times A$, cartesian products aren't [[Properties of Integer#Commutativity (交换律)|commutative]] and [[Properties of Integer#Associativity (结合律)|associative]] 
- Depends on the number of elements in the given set - `n`, the Cartesian product is a set of [[Ordered Pair#Order n-tuples]]

>[!question] Why is it called Cartesian?
> Cartesian Product of real numbers is basically a set that contains all the possible $(x,y)$ coordinates on the **Cartesian Plane**.
