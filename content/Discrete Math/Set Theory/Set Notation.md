### Set-Roster Notation
$$
\{1, 2, 3\}
$$
$$
\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}
$$
$$
\{1,2,3, \ldots\}
$$
- A [[Set|Set]] may be specified by writing all of its elements between braces 
- Symbol $\ldots$ is called **ellipsis** and read "and so forth"
### Set-Builder Notation
$$
\{x \in U : P(x)\}
$$
$$
\{x \in U | P(x)\}
$$
- The set of all `x` in `U` such that `P(x)` is true

### Replacement Notation
$$
\{t(x) : x \in A\}
$$
$$
\{t(x) | x \in A\}
$$
- For elements x in `A`, we apply the function `t(x)`
