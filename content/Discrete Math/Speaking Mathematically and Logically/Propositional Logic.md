## Abstract
---
- Deals with the logic of [[Mathematical Statement]]

### Ambiguous
- Happen without the proper use of parentheses to indicate the intended order of operations
- We need to use proper parentheses to ensure there's **only one way** to interpret and evaluate each expression

### Logical Connectives 
- Negation: `NOT` performed first
- Disjunction: `OR`, Conjunction: `AND` coequal, make sure proper parentheses is used to avoid [[#Ambiguous]]
- If-then/implies: performed last, coequal with `iff`


## Logical Equivalence
---

- The above is **Theorem 2.1.1**
- We have a logical equivalence when 2 [[Mathematical Statement]] have **identical truth values**

>[!important]
> The above diagram shows **Logical Equivalence Laws** that can used to simplify mathematical statement.


>[!important] 2 ways to check for logical equivalence
> 1. **Truth table** - Find a row where truth values are different
> 2. **Find a counter example** - Substitute a concrete [[Mathematical Statement]], then compare

>[!caution] Usage of Laws
> We can only perform the **laws** when the exact form is matched.
