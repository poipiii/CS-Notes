## Abstract
---
- A sequence of [[#Premise]] ending in a [[#Conclusion]]
- Every step should **follow logically** from all previous steps
- `IF (p AND ... p) THEN Conclusion` is a [[Mathematical Statement#Tautology]]
- An **argument** can be [[#Valid]], but if the Premise is not true, the Conclusion is going to be false

### Premise
- Also known as **Assumption** or **Hypothesis**
- A [[Mathematical Statement]]
### Conclusion
- A [[Mathematical Statement]] that must be true when all [[#Premise]] are true, in order for the [[Mathematical Argument]] to be [[#Valid]]



## Validity
---
### Critical Row
- A row of **Truth Table** in which all the [[#Premise]] are true
### Valid
- *Does the conclusion follow logically from the premises,Â regardless of whether those premises are actually true?*
- [[Mathematical Argument]] is said to be **Valid** if and only if whenever [[Mathematical Statement]] substituted that make all [[#Premise]] true, and the [[#Conclusion]] **is also true** 
- The conclusion logically follows from the premises. It doesn't guarantee that the premises themselves are actually true.

>[!important]
> There is [[#Critical Row]] in which Conclusion is false: **invalid**.
> 
> The Conclusion in every Critical Row is true: **valid**.
> 
> For all non-critical rows, regardless is conclusion is true or false: **valid**.


### Sound
- A [[Mathematical Argument]] is called **sound** if & only if it is [[#Valid]] **AND** all the [[#Premise]] is true. That means the [[#Conclusion]] also must be true
