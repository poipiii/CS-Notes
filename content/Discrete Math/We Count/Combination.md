## Abstract
---
- The **selection of items** from a larger set **without considering the order** of selection. That means each combination has an **unique set of items**
- The number of combinations can be calculated using the [[#Binomial Coefficient]]


## Combination Questions
---
### Single Set
- [77. Combinations](https://leetcode.cn/problems/combinations/)
- [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.cn/problems/combination-sum/)
- [40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.cn/problems/combination-sum-ii/)
- [216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.cn/problems/combination-sum-iii/)
### Multiple Sets
- [17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.cn/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/) - essentially, finding the [[Cartesian Product]] involves treating **each phone number** as a [[Set]]

### Partition (分割)
