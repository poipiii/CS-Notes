## abstract
- key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
- focuses on hiding the implementation details of a complex piece code and revealing only the essential features to the user
- allows  programmer use the code at a high level, without needing to understand its internal workings



## Benefits of abstraction
- **[[Encapsulation]]**: Protects the internal workings of a component from being exposed, promoting modularity.
- **Flexibility**: Makes it easier to modify or replace code  without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Maintenance**: Simplifies debugging and updating code by isolating changes or errors to specific areas.
