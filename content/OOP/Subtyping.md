## Abstract
---
- A [[Datatype|data type]] $T$ is a **subtype** of a data type $S$ if a piece of **code written for** a variable of data type $S$ can also be **safely used** on a variable of data type $T$
- The relationship can be represented with $T <: S$, where $S$ is also known as the **super type** of $T$

>[!example] Java
> Subtyping among Java [[#Primitive Datatype]]
> - `byte` <: `short` <: `int` <: `long` <: `float` <: `double`
> - `char` <: `int` <: `long` <: `float` <: `double`

>[!important]
> Subtyping is [[Relation#Reflexive]], $T <: T$
> 
> Subtyping is [[Relation#Transitive]], if $S <: T$ and $T <: U$, then $S <: U$

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>you can cast/make a parent type a child type but not the other way around 
>example you can put a `float` number in args of a function that expects a `double` and it will work because you can pad/extend a `float` to be a `double` but not the other way around  
>
>

>[!important] In java only
>Anti symmetry: if $S <: T$ and $T <: S$ then $S$ must be the same type as $T$
>
>

>[!important] OOP 
> It can be a type that inherits from a [[OOP#OOP Class]] or [[Interface]]. Less specific compared to [[Sub-class]]


### Compile-time Type vs Run-time Type
- We can assign a [[Subtyping|subtype]] **instance** to a [[Subtyping|supertype]] variable **during compilation**
- **At runtime**, we **can call all methods** with **matching [[Function#Function Signature|signatures]]** declared **in the supertype** on the subtype instance, **including those [[OOP Method#Method Overriding|overridden]] in the subtype**

>[!important]
> The **runtime type** of an object is **always a subtype** of its **compile-time type**.
> 
> At compile time, the compile-time type is identified, and the method descriptor in the compile-time type is stored in the generated bytecode. When the runtime type is determined during runtime, Java then looks for an accessible method with a matching descriptor in that runtime type.



## Dynamic Binding
---
- Also known as **late binding**
- A concept in programming where the [[OOP Method|method]] to be invoked is determined [[#Compile-time Type vs Run-time Type|at runtime rather than at compile-time]]. The actual method that is called is decided based on the runtime type of the object



>[!important]
> A key feature that enables [[Polymorphism|polymorphism]]. Polymorphism allows **objects of different classes** to be **treated as** objects of a **common super class**, particularly when it comes to method calls.

>[!example]
> In Java, every object inherits the `toString()` method from the [[Java#The Mother of All Classes|Object]] class. This method is used by `System.out.println()` to display the object's representation on the console. The implementation of `toString()` can vary depending on the object's [[Datatype|data type]]. At runtime, the specific implementation of `toString()` corresponding to the object's actual data type is called to determine how the object is represented in the console output.
