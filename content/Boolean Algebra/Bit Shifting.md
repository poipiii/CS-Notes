## Abstract
---
- Moving the bits to the left side or right side, by a specified number of bits


## MIPS Bit Shifting
---
- `sll` is **multiplication** with $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits we shift
- `srl` is **division** with $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits we shift

>[!important] Maximum number of bits we can shift
> $31$, because the [[Register]] is 32 bits
