## Abstract
---
- `r` is rational $\leftrightarrow$ there are integers `a` and `b` such that `r=a/b` and `b!=0`
- Represented with the symbol $\mathbb{Q}$ (0.5, -23, 8.5)

### Theorem 4.2.1
- Every integer is a rational number
### Theorem 4.3.2
- The sum of any two rational numbers is rational
### Corollary 4.2.3
- The double of a rational number is rational 
- Derived from [[#Theorem 4.3.2]]
