## Abstract
---
- Handled [[CSMA#Collision]] by making the sending computers wait for a **random time interval** before re-sending the [[Data]].
- If a collision occurs again, indicating [[Network Congestion]], the waiting time will increase exponentially to reduce the rate of [[Collisions]]
- Used by [[Ethernet]], [[Wi-Fi]], and in the [[CSMA]] approach.
