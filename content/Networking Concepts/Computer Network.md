### Network Route
- The sequence of [[Communication Links]] and [[Network Switch]] traversed by a [[Network Packet]] between [[Host#Client]] and [[Host#Server]]



## 4 MainTypes of Networks 
---
- From smallest to biggest
### Personal Area Network (PAN)
- Around a person (about a meter)
>[!info] Wireless PAN
>Connected wirelessly like [[Bluetooth]] 

>[!example]
>- Phone connected to computer
>- Flash Drive

### Local Area Network (LAN)
- Local to a site like home
- Usually connected using [[Ethernet]]

>[!info] Wireless Lan (WLAN)
>- [[Wi-Fi]]
>- [[Tethering]]

>[!example]
>Computer and phones in a house

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- From the scale of a few blocks to a city

### Wide Area Network (WAN)
- Anything beyond the scale of [[#Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)]]
- Typically national or cross countries
- Large scale uses undersea fibre optics cables

## Special Types of Network
---
- From smallest to biggest
### Controller Area Network (CAN)
- Similar to [[#Personal Area Network (PAN)]]

>[!note] Key Distinguishing Feature
>The [[Computer Network]] not controlled by a [[Host]]

>[!example]
>- A system of sensors in car

### Storage Area Network (SAN)
- Similar to [[#Local Area Network (LAN)]]

>[!note] Key Distinguishing Features
> - A [[Computer Network]] of storage devices separated from the actual [[#Local Area Network (LAN)]]
> - Appears to a connected computers as a local device/drive
