## Abstract
---
- Each node has $0$ to $2$ [[#Edge]]
- The maximum number of nodes at the `nth` [[Tree#Level|level]] is `2^(n-1)`, counting from $1$

>[!bigbrain]- Implementation with Linked List
> Refer to [[Linked List]] to understand its properties.

## Binary Tree Array Representation
---

 ![[binary_tree_array.png|400]]
- Given the index of a parent node `i`, the **index of its left child** is calculated as `i * 2 + 1`, the **index of its right child** is calculated as `i * 2 + 2`. We can find the **index of its parent node** with `(i - 1) / 2`

## Binary Tree Linked List Representation
---
 ![[binary_tree_linked_list.png|400]]
- Compared to the [[#Binary Tree Array Representation|array representation]], the linked list representation of a binary tree is **easier to scale in terms of size**, but it comes with **higher memory usage** due to the overhead of storing pointers for each node. Additionally, it cannot take advantage of [[Cache Locality|CPU cache locality]] as effectively as the array representation
## Degenerate Binary Tree
---
![[bst_to_skewed_tree.png|400]]

- A [[Binary Tree]] in which each parent node has only one child node associated with it. Such a tree behaves like a [[Linked List]], resulting in $O(n)$ complexity for search, insertion and deletion

>[!attention] Poor performance!
> Binary tree should deliver $O(logn)$ in the ideal situation.
