## Abstract
---
- The **standard monitoring tool** used in **container** and **microservices infrastructure**

>[!question] Why we need Prometheus?
> **Hundreds of interconnected processes** serve users in these environments. If one process fails, it can trigger a **cascade of failures in other processes**, making it **difficult to pinpoint the root cause** from the end user's perspective. Prometheus provides visibility into the application and infrastructure of these hundreds of processes, **enabling proactive identification of issues instead of reactive debugging**. With Prometheus, we can continuously monitor processes, receive alerts about crashes, and even configure alerts for predefined thresholds.

### Prometheus Metric
- **HELP attribute:** Provides a clear description of the metric's purpose
- **TYPE attribute:** Defines the metric's type. Prometheus supports four core metric types:
	- **Counter:** A cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter. Its value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart. Examples: the number of requests served, tasks completed, or errors encountered
	- **Gauge:** A metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down. Examples: current memory usage, temperature, or the number of active processes
	- **Histogram:** Samples observations (like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values
	- **Summary?**: Similar to histograms, but they calculate quantiles on the client-side and expose them directly. Useful for tracking percentiles of observations like request latencies

### Prometheus Configuration File
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - "first.rules"
  - "second.rules"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: node_exporter
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_timeout: 1m
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```


- Under `global`, `scrape_interval: 15s` instructs the Prometheus server to **scrape target endpoints** every **15 seconds**. `evaluation_interval: 15s` runs the rules defined in `rules_files` every **15 seconds**, potentially triggering alerts in the [[#Prometheus Alert Manager|Prometheus Alert Manager]]
- Scrape job details are specified under `scrape_configs`, allowing you to **override global settings** like `scrape_interval`

>[!important] Default setting for each scrape job
> We have default settings like `metrics_path: "/metrics"` and `scheme: "http"` for each job.

## Prometheus Architecture

### Prometheus Metric Retrieval
- The Prometheus server has a **metrics retrieval** component that **pulls data** from different **targets**, which are essentially various processes. This data consists of **units** such as CPU status, exception count, and request count. These units are considered [[#Prometheus Metric]] when monitored by Prometheus. The metrics are then stored in the [[#Prometheus Data Storage|time-series database (TSDB)]]
- Prometheus also includes an HTTP server component that accepts PromQL queries, enabling integration with visualisation tools like Grafana

>[!important] A pulling system
> Common monitoring services like AWS CloudWatch and [[Datadog]] use a **pushing** approach, where all processes push metrics to a centralized collection platform. This can create a **high load of network traffic**, and monitoring can become a bottleneck. Additionally, we need to install a daemon on all processes to push metrics, while Prometheus only needs a **scraping endpoint**. The pulling approach is also a convenient way to check if a process is up.

>[!question] How is Prometheus metric pulled?
> Prometheus metrics are pulled by accessing an **HTTP endpoint on the target**. This endpoint, typically `/metrics`, must expose data in a **format that Prometheus understands**. If the target doesn't have a compatible endpoint, a [[#Prometheus Exporter]] can be used to bridge the gap.

>[!question] How does Prometheus server find the targets?
> Prometheus uses **service discovery services** to find the targets.



### Prometheus Exporter
- An **exporter** is a piece of software that fetches metrics from a target application and converts them into a format [[Prometheus]] understands. It then exposes these metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint, where Prometheus can scrape them. You can find a list of exporters for different processes [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)

>[!question] What if my application is running inside a container?
> You can deploy the exporter as a **sidecar container** alongside your application container. You can also use [Prometheus client libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) to instrument your application code and directly expose metrics about requests, exceptions, and other custom metrics.


### Prometheus Push Gateway
- Pushgateway is a service that allows you to monitor **short-lived jobs**, like batch jobs or [[Cron Job|cron jobs]], with Prometheus

> [!question] why it's necessary:
> **Short-lived jobs and scraping:** Prometheus typically works by "scraping" metrics from targets at regular intervals. If a job finishes before the scrape happens, Prometheus might miss its metrics entirely.
> 
> **Pushgateway as a buffer:** The Pushgateway acts as an intermediary. Short-lived jobs *push* their metrics to the Pushgateway. Prometheus then scrapes the Pushgateway, ensuring those metrics are collected even if the job has already finished.


### Prometheus Alert Manager
- [[Prometheus]] evalutes the rules and push alerts to Prometheus alert manager which will fire the alerts to different notification channel like email 

### Prometheus Data Storage
- [[Prometheus]] stores **time series data** in a time-series database (TSDB) on the local [[File System|filesystem]], but it can also optionally integrate with remote storage systems. The data is stored in a **custom time series format**, so we can't write it directly into a [[Database Paradigms#Relational|relational database]]

>[!important]
> By default, this data is stored in the **`data/`** directory within Prometheus's working directory. You can customize this location by modifying the **`--storage.tsdb.path`** flag when starting Prometheus.
> 
> To control how long Prometheus retains data, use the **`--storage.tsdb.retention.time`** flag. This flag accepts a duration value (e.g., **`15d`** for 15 days).

### Prometheus PromQL
- The query format used to obtain data from the [[#Prometheus Data Storage]], used by data visulisation tool like Grafana to create nice dashboards
- This is the **query language** used to retrieve data from [[#Prometheus Data Storage|Prometheus's time series database]]. Visualisation tools like **Grafana use PromQL** to create informative dashboards

%% Prometheus is the **de facto standard** for monitoring Kubernetes clusters. It easily integrates with Kubernetes by discovering services dynamically through Kubernetes' API, which enables it to monitor containerized applications without needing manual configuration of targets. %%
