## Abstract

![[pointer_arithmetic_c.png|500]]

- When we increment or decrement a [[Pointer|pointer]], we are doing it in **units of its corresponding data type**. So, for the above example, the data type takes **4 bytes**. Therefore, when we increment or decrement by one, we are actually adding or subtracting 4 bytes
