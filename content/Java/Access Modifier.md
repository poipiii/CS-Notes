## Abstract
---
- Keywords that define the accessibility or scope of [[OOP#OOP Class|classes]], [[OOP Method|methods]], and field

>[!important] Good design
> We should make all attributes within the class [[#private|private]]. 
> 
> Use methods to enforce access or modify attribute values if necessary, but this is generally not recommended.

## private
---
- When a field or [[OOP Method]] is declared as `private`, it can only be accessed within the [[OOP#OOP Class|class]] in which it is declared. Direct access from outside the class is not allowed. This helps with maintaining the [[Software Engineering/Abstraction#Abstraction Barrier|abstraction barrier]]

>[!important]
> Objects of the same class **can access** each other's `private` fields and methods. Because the `private` access modifier restricts access at the **class level**, not the **object level**.
