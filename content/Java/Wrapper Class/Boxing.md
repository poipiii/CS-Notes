## Abstract
---
- Facilities the integration between [[OOP]] concepts with low level [[Datatype#Primitive Datatype]]
- Take primitive datatype & put it inside an [[OOP#OOP Object]] of [[Wrapper Class]]
- Aka converting primitive to object 

### Auto-boxing
- [[Boxing]] but without explicitly the use of `new` keyword, [[Language Processors#Compiler]] does the work automatically 


## Unboxing
---
```java
int intVal = numObject.intValue();
```

- The opposite of [[Boxing]]


### Auto-unboxing
* [[#Unboxing]] but without explicitly calling built-in method
