## Abstract
---
- Represent different characters in terms of [[Computer Data Representation#Bit String]]
- There are many different character encoding standards like [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), [GBK (character encoding)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBK_(character_encoding)#:~:text=GBK%20is%20an%20extension%20of,%3A1993%2C%20or%20Unicode%201.1.) and [[#UTF-8]] etc

>[!caution] Incompatible Encoding Standard
> Characters encoded in one standard may be displayed differently in another standard.
> 
> We should always use the same character encoding standard, UTF-8 is recommended. And if we see characters that are not displayed correctly, we shouldn't save the file, because saving will overwrite the file with placeholders for those wrongly displayed characters.

>[!important]
> Programming languages like **Python** use the number of [code point](utf_8_code_point.png) of the string as the length of the string, not the number of characters. One example is 👍🏻 which is represented with two code points, you will get two instead of one as the length of the string.
> 
> System programming languages more likely to use [[#Unicode Unaware String Function]] which counts the number of [[Computer Data Representation#Byte]] used to store a string.

## UTF-8

![[utf-8_space_saving.png|500]]
- [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) allows **variable-length encoding** which means [code point](utf_8_code_point.png) is variable-length, this brings a great amount of space saving to store different characters. As shown above, we use 1 [[Computer Data Representation#Byte]] to store **a**, 4 bytes to store 😊, and 3 bytes to store **家**. Without variable-length encoding, we need to use 4 bytes to store each character.



## Unicode Unaware String Function
---
- Unicode Unaware String Function counts the **numbers of [[Computer Data Representation#Byte]]** used by the string, and **not the number of characters** inside the string
- String in [[Go]] is encoded with [[#UTF-8]] and is treated as an [[Array]] of [[Computer Data Representation#Byte]]. This explains why the index is off and `len(myString)` returns $8$, instead of $6$

![[utf-8_string_go.png|500]]
- This behaviour applies to other languages like [[C/C]], you get $7$ when you run `printf("%d", strlen("😊家"));`, instead of $2$


>[!tip] Abstract away this weird behavior 
> We can cast the string to an array of `rune` to have an intuitive interface to the string in Go as shown below. But `rune` as you can see below is `int32`, this approach comes with some space sacrifices.
