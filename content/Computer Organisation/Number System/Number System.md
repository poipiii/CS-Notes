> We convert from one base to decimal base with the help of the [[#Radix|radix]], then from decimal base convert to the desired base by either **division** with that particular base for the whole number or **multiplication** with that particular base for the fraction.

### Whole Number Decimal to Binary
![[decimal_to_binary_1.png|300]]

- Keep diving by 2 until we get 0
- Then the binary form counts from **bottom to top**

>[!important]
> The idea applies to other bases; replace 2 with the corresponding [[#Radix|radix]].

### Fraction Decimal to Binary
![[decimal_to_binary_2.png]]

- Keep multiple by 2 until we get **1** or **infinite loop**
- Then the binary form counts from **top to bottom**

## Radix
---
$$
(a_k a_{k-1} ... a_1 a_0 . a_{-1} a_{-2} ... a_{-m})_n = 
a_k \cdot n^k + a_{k-1} \cdot n^{k-1} + ... + a_1 \cdot n^1 + a_0 \cdot n^0 
+ a_{-1} \cdot n^{-1} + a_{-2} \cdot n^{-2} + ... + a_{-m} \cdot n^{-m}
$$

- Also known as **Base**
- The **number of unique digits**, including zero, used to **represent numbers** within that system
- The formula above can be used to convert any base-R to a  decimal number

>[!important]
> Weights are represented in powers of the radix (R). In base-2, weights are expressed in terms of powers of 2, and in base-10, they are expressed in terms of powers of 10.

>[!important] Radix representation in C
> In C, by default, all numbers are interpreted as base-10 (decimal). To represent numbers in other bases, you can use specific prefixes:
> - Prefix `0` for octal (base-8) representation
> - Prefix `0x` or `0X` for hexadecimal (base-16) representation
