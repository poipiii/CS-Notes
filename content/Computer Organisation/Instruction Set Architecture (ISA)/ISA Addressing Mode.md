## Abstract
---
- Ways to specify an [[ISA Instruction Format#Instruction Operand]] in an assembly language


## Register Addressing Mode
---
- [[ISA Instruction Format#Instruction Operand]] is in a [[Register]] (`add $t1, $t2, $t3`)


## Immediate Addressing Mode
---
- [[ISA Instruction Format#Instruction Operand]] is in a [[Instruction]] directly (`addi $t1, $t2, 98`)

## Displacement Addressing Mode
---
- [[ISA Instruction Format#Instruction Operand]] is in [[Main Memory|memory]] with [[Memory Address]] calculated as `Base + Offset` (`lw $t1, 20($t2)`)


## PC-relative Addressing Mode
---
- [[ISA Instruction Format#Instruction Operand]] is the sum of [[Register#Program Counter]] and constant in the instruction (`beq`, `bne`)
