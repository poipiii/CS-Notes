## Abstract
---
- Since [[Instruction Stages]] are independent of each other on a hardware-level, this allows [[CPU]] to start the next [[Computer Organisation/Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)/Instruction | Instruction]] without the need for the current [[Instruction]] to complete

>[!caution]
> Certain combinations of [[Instruction]] back to back can create [[Read-After-Write(RAW) Hazard]].
