## Abstract
---
- Present output = present input

>[!important]
> Any combination circuit with $n$ input and $m$ outputs can be implemented with an $n:2^n$ [[Decoder|decoder]] with $m$ [[OR|OR gates]].
> 
> This is useful when the circuit has **many outputs**, and each [[Boolean Function|function]] is expressed with with **a few** [[Minterm|minterms]].


>[!example]
>- [[Adder]]
>- [[Encoder]]
>- [[Decoder]]
>- [[Multiplexer]]
>- [[Multiplexer#De-multiplexer]]
