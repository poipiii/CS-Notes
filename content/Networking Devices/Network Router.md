## Abstract
---
- Also known as **Default Gateway**, this is usually the gateway to the [[Internet]] on a [[Computer Network#Local Area Network (LAN)]]
- A device that connects two or more **IP networks**


## Packet Loss
---
- Queue for a [[Network Router]] has a finite capacity. If the queue is full, the router will drop a packet when it arrives. Thus, packet is lost 

## Packet Switching
---
- A form of **multiplexing**
- Data is divided into smaller segments called **packets**. This allows **multiple data files to be transmitted simultaneously** without interfering with each other. Each packet is a relatively small unit of data, so multiple packets can be transmitted simultaneously. If a portion of the data is corrupted, only the affected packets need to be resent.
