## Abstract
---
- Systematic way of solving a given problem

## 9 Tips
---
### 1. Use the defining features of the set-up
1. Look at what is given
2. Ask the definition of each term
3. How the ideas piece up together (**infer**) 
>[!example] Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle,  [[Inscribed Angle Theorem.excalidraw]]
>1. We are given a Circle
>2. Definition of Circle
>	1. It has a **radius** which is a line from the center of circle to its circumference
>3. Piece the ideas up
>	1. **Any lines** from the center of circle to its circumference is the **same length**
### 2. Giving things (meaningful) names
- Give names to objects that describe its properties (Or to differentiate each one)
- It is like forming an [[Software Engineering/Abstraction]] over something, then we have more brain power to build on top of it
>[!example] Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle,  [[Inscribed Angle Theorem.excalidraw]]
>1. Give [[Θ (Theta)]] a name
### 3. Leverage symmetry
- Obtaining another piece of information based on reflection/symmetry, basically using reflection/symmetry to **generate more useful information**
>[!example] Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle,  [[Inscribed Angle Theorem.excalidraw]]
>- Since the angle is 90degrees, 2 out 3 sides are the same. The 2 triangles obtained after divided are basically the same triangle, symmetry of each other
>- Thus, we can conclude that a == b, d == e
### 4. Try describing 1 object 2 ways
- Explaining something in 2 different perspectives. 2 different paths to the same object, likely to have **some different knowledge points**. This helps to have **more connections**. Thus, coming out with more creative ideas
- For example, counting the possible permutation of a string of 5 bits. 1) Count the exponential 2) Count the possible permutation one by one
>[!example] Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle,  [[Double-angle Formula for cosine.excalidraw]]
>- Proof cos2(a) == 1/2 * (1 + cos(2θ)) by describing the cos2(a) &  cos(2θ) on the graph 
### 5. Draw a picture
- This helps with [[Visualisation]]
- One way to visualise numbers is to associate they with coordinates, then we can present the numbers & their relationship in graph format
>[!example] See [[Problem Solving Sample Problem]]
### 6. Ask a simpler version of the problem
- Find a problem that has the similar setup, but easier to solve or more approachable to **get more sense/clue** of the original problem
>[!example] See [[Problem Solving Sample Problem]]
### 7. Read a lot, and think about problems a lot
- Insights & ingenuity is basically **pattern recognition**
- Using obsidian to connect the ideas, structure messy knowledge nodes, let nodes interconnect with each other, form a **network of pattern recognition**, so **each node** has a lot of **contact points** via **directly and indirectly connected nodes**
- With connections and repetitions, the knowledge points will be embedded into sub-conscious which is much more efficient than and powerful than conscious  
### 8. Always gut-check your answer
- There isn't perfection, the ability to identify mistakes & give fixes is golden 
### 9. Learn at least a little bit of programming
- Helps to provide a different perspective to math which is very abstracted
- We can also take advantage of its ability to generate a massive set of numbers to get a rough estimation trend or pattern
