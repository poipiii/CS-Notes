## Abstract
---
- Consists of [[Kernel]] and [[OS System Program]]
- 2 main functionalities
	1. Provide user features in the form of [[Software Engineering/Abstraction#Abstraction Barrier]] to **interact with the hardware**. Some key abstractions are [[Process (进程)]], [[Thread]], [[Address Space]] and [[File System]]
	2. Resource Manager for resources like [[CPU]], [[IO Device]] & [[Main Memory]] etc

>[!important]
> As you can see from the two main functionalities of OS. OS aims to be a **general-purpose software** that **provides a platform** for users to **build on top** to complete different tasks. At the same time, OS **manages** the **direct communication** with the **hardware**.


>[!question] Do we even need an OS?
> We **can remove the OS software** if we build our **solution directly on top of the hardware** without the need of abstraction and  we **manages the direct communication** with the **hardware**. 
> 
> The benefit of doing so is **huge huge performance gains**. OS comes with **many abstractions** to **be general-purpose**, all these abstractions come with **overheads**! So the task that doesn't need an OS needs to be a **very specific task** that **aren't built on many abstractions**.


## Types of OS
---
### Embedded OS
- Run on devices like ovens, no un-trusted software will ever run on it
- All software in [[ROM]]
- Example are [[OpenWRT]] and [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/index.html)

### Smart Card OS
- Smallest [[OS]] run on smart cards
- Used in [[Electronic Payment]] etc
- Some are [[Java]] oriented 

### Server OS
- Provides file service or Web services etc
- Examples are [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux Kernel]] and [[Windows Server]]

### Sensor-Node OS
- Running on sensor node that has very limited [[CPU]], [[Main Memory]] & [[ROM]]
- Example is [TinyOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyOS)

### Real-Time OS
- Allow **multiple tasks** to run at the **same time**
- 2 Types - [[Hard Real-Time System]] & [[Soft Real-Time System]]
- Example is [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/index.html), used by [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32)

### Personal Computer OS
- Support [[Multi-programming]] - dozens of programs started up at boot time
- Provide good support to a single user
- Widely used for word processing, spreadsheets & gaming etc
- Example are [[Linux Kernel]] and [[Windows]]

### Handheld Computer OS
- Examples are [[Android]] and [[iOS]]

### Mainframe OS
- Act as [[#Batch System]], [[Concurrency (并发)#Multi-tasking]], [[#Transaction-processing System]]
- IO intense, for enterprise
- Gradually replaced by UNIX variants like [[Linux Kernel]]
- Examples are like OS/390 and OS/360

### Multi-processor OS
- Make use of multiple [[CPU]] and [[Multi-core Chip]] in a single system
- Examples are [[Linux Kernel]] and [[Windows]]


## Terminologies
---
### Batch System
- Process jobs without any interactive user present
### Transaction-processing System
- Handle large number of of small requests, hundreds/thousands per second
