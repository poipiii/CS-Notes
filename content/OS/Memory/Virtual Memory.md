## Abstract

![[data_retrieval_during_process_execution.svg]]

- An [[Software Engineering/Abstraction|abstraction]] that maps [[#Virtual Address]] to [[Main Memory#Physical Address]]. In layman's terms, virtual memory takes **program addresses** and **maps them** to **RAM addresses**. The mapping is known as [[Page Table]] which is handled by [[MMU]]

>[!important]
> The **mapping** gives us **flexibility** in how we use the physical [[Main Memory]].


>[!success] Handles memory fragmentation
> **Problem**: programs may **not be able to fit** into the main memory. A program **needs a block of main memory**, but we will have [[Memory Fragmentation]] issues **as we run and exit programs**.
>
>  **Virtual memory solution:** With [[#Virtual Address|virtual addressing]], the [[Kernel]] decouples data placement from the main memory. It is able to **break down** [[Address Space]] into **smaller sizes** and fit them inside **fragmented main memory**, thus solving the memory fragmentation issue.


>[!success] Creates the illusion of more memory
> **Problem:** Usually, for 32-bit [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)]], each [[Process (进程)]] is promised a 32-bit [[Address Space]], which is 4GB. It's **impossible** to **allocate 4GB** of main memory to **every process** or we just **don't have 4GB of main memory**. So, if a process tries to read from certain addresses, a **crash may occur**. The same idea applies to 64-bit ISA.

> **Virtual memory solution:** With **virtual addressing**, the **kernel** controls **memory mapping**. It can assign **virtual address** to point to the [[Flash Memory]], using it to store process data outside of main memory in the form of [[Swap Space]]. However, accessing this data will result in a [[Page Fault]] which is a **big performance hit**.



>[!success] Prevent programs writing over each other
> **Problem**: Since all processes are using the **same number of bits** to **find data** in the **main memory**, they can **freely read** and **write** to the data and [[Instruction]] of **other processes**.
>
> **Virtual memory solution:** Virtual memory promises each process its **own blank** [[Main Memory]]. The virtual memory **handles** the **underlying mapping** to the corresponding [[Main Memory#Physical Address]]. However, this means that **data sharing among programs** can be slightly **tricky**, the underlying mapping for each programs need to point to the same [[Main Memory#Physical Address]].

### Virtual Address
- Also known as **Logical Address**
- The addressing system for [[Virtual Memory]], not bounded to physical [[Main Memory]]

>[!important]
> The address that the [[Process (进程)]] sees and uses to retrieve data or [[Instruction]].
