- One way to design a [[CPU Cache|CPU cache]] is to have it consist of a number of sets, each containing $n$ [[CPU Cache#Cache Line|cache lines]]. Within a set, a memory block can be placed in any of the $n$ cache lines.
- In the above example, we have a 2-way set associative cache. The [[CPU Cache]] has $2^{1}$ sets, each containing $2$ cache lines. Each contains $2^{1}$ words, and each [[Computer Data Representation#Word|word]] is $2^2$ bytes

> Set associative caches reduce the likelihood of [[Cache Miss#Conflict Miss|conflict misses]] compared to [[Direct Mapped Cache|direct-mapped caches]]. In a direct-mapped cache, if two **frequently accessed memory locations map to the same cache index, they will constantly evict each other,** causing repeated conflict misses. A set associative cache provides multiple cache lines within each set, allowing these memory locations to **coexist in the cache simultaneously**, minimising conflict misses and improving performance.

> 1. We first use the **set index to locate the set**
> 2. We simultaneously "search" on all **valid bit** and **tags** of the set to check if one of the cache line contains data. If it does, and the **tag matches the given address**, we can select the word needed using with a help of a [[Multiplexer]]
> 3. Otherwise, there is a cache miss.
