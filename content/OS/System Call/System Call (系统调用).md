## Abstract
---
- A form of [[Interrupts (中断)#Software Interrupt]] that allows [[Process (进程)]] in [[User Space]] to request **privileged services** like hardware access from the [[Kernel]]


>[!success] Better Security
> Since **privileged services** are carried out by the kernel, kernel can enforce **security implementation**. This prevents programs from doing malicious stuff.


## System Call Mechanism
---

![[system_call_triggering_process.png|500]]

**Step 1-3:** Calling [[Process (进程)]] pushes the arguments for the parameters of the system call to its [[Address Space#Stack Segment]]

**Step 4**(the start of [[Library Call]]): An [[Instruction]] is triggered to trigger the corresponding Library Call, the same instruction is used to trigger other library calls

**Step 5** Library Call puts **system call interrupt number** in a place where [[Kernel]] expects it, such as a [[Register]]

**Step 6:** Execute [[Trap Interrupt (陷入)]] to enter the [[Privilege Level#Kernel Mode]] and start execution at a **fixed address within the kernel**

**Step 7:** The **kernel codes** following the trap interrupt examines **system call interrupt number**, dispatch the correct [[Interrupt Handler]] via [[Interrupt Vector Table]]

**Step 8:** The desired Interrupt Handler starts running

**Step 9:** After the interrupt handler finishes, control is returned to the library call at the Instruction following the Trap Interrupt (陷入)

**Step 10:** Then, library call returns, and we are back to the user program

**Step 11:** To finish the job, the process needs to remove the library call related data like the arguments we pushed to the stack segment from its stack segment by **incrementing** the [[Register#Stack Pointer]]


>[!important] System call & process management
> Control is passed back to the [[Kernel]] when a system call is made by the [[Process (进程)]]. Kernel uses this opportunity to perform its [[Process Management]]. If the process hogs to the [[CPU]] and doesn't make any system call, we have [[Concurrency (并发)#Preemptive Scheduling]] to handle this.

>[!tip]
> The system calls made by a process can be traced by [``strace``](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65510246/can-a-system-call-happen-in-a-c-program).

## System Call is ISA-dependent 
---

![[syscall_architecture_differences.png|500]]

- The actual mechanics of issuing a system call are highly [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)]] **dependent** and often must be expressed in [[Assembly language]]. For example, some ISA may expect the parameters be stored in [[Address Space#Stack Segment]] of the [[Kernel]], some ISA may expect the parameters be stored in [[Register]]


>[!success] Solution: abstraction!
> We have [[Software Engineering/Abstraction#Abstraction Barrier]] built on top of these [[System Call (系统调用)]] in the form of [[Library Call]] that follows a standardised interface like [[POSIX]] by wrapping the [[Assembly language |Assembly Instruction]] of different ISAs. Specific ISA [[Instruction]] is generated during [[Compilation]] automatically.
> 
> This makes it possible for user programs like [[OS System Program]] to make system call that requests privileged services from the kernel **regardless of the underlying ISA** - user program is communicating with **library call** **directly** and communicating with **system call** **indirectly**!
> 
> [[Unix#Unix-like]] systems use [[Library Call#libc]] and Windows uses [ntdll.dll](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/libraries-and-headers).

>[!important]
>Program should always check the results of Library Call to see if an error has occurred.

## Linux System Call

![[system_calls.png|500]]

- Above is a standardised set of [[Library Call]] that wraps [[System Call (系统调用)]], almost **1-to-1**. Here is a [full list](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html)



## Windows System Call

- The list above shows the [[Library Call]] which is powered by Windows' [[System Call (系统调用)]]
