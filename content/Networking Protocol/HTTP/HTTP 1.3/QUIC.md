## Abstract
- Stands for *Quick UDP Internet Connections*
- Think of QUIC as being similar to [[TCP]]+[[TLS]]+[[HTTP 1.2]] implemented on [[UDP]] (Like [[TCP]] 2.0)
- Built on top of [[UDP]] but the mechanism is based on [[TCP]]

- Integrating [[TCP Handshake]] with [[TLS Handshake]] into [[QUIC Handshake]]

>[!info] We can't change [[TCP]] like how we change [[HTTP]] to solve the TCP Head-of-Line Blocking issue, because changing [[TCP]] requires changes made to all the [[Kernel]] which is much harder than changing browser 



>[!success] Solve [[Head-of-Line Blocking (队头堵塞)#TCP Head-of-Line Blocking]] with [[[#QUIC Stream]]


## QUIC Frame
- Similar to the [[HTTP Frame]], there isn't [[HTTP Frame]] in [[HTTP 1.3]]

## QUIC Stream
- Introduce [[HTTP Stream]] in the [[Transport Layer]]
- An [[Software Engineering/Abstraction]] of [[HTTP Request]]/[[HTTP Response]] into [[#QUIC Frame]]]
